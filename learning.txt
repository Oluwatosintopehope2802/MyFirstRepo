One thing I’ve learned so far in this course is how to create and manage a GitHub repository, including writing README files and understanding basic version control workflows.
Through practical tasks like creating my first repository, writing structured documentation, and submitting assignments using Git, I’ve gained confidence in using GitHub as a collaborative tool. 
This hands-on experience has shown me the value of tracking changes, writing clear documentation, and preparing my work for public or team visibility in a professional way.
